# Bayesian-Stats-NNets:

The Repository Contains code in an attempt to learn Gaussian Process and Bayesian statistics using PyMC3. This reppository will introduce to various concepts in Bayesian Statistics and eventually lead to their implemenetation in Deep-Neural-Nets.

Most of the code are refered and build upon (only for learning purpose) from Thomas Wiecki's Awesome blog posts from
